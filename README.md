# Guessing-game
This is a guessing game where the user can choose to play alone or with another player. The user is prompted to select a range of numbers to guess from and then a random number is generated within that range. The user(s) then input their guesses and are told if their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number. The game keeps track of the number of guesses it takes to reach the correct number and assigns a score based on that. If playing with another player, each player takes turns guessing and the scores are kept separate. The game also allows the user to play again after finishing a round.
